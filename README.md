This study uses network analysis to look at the practice of Social Media Mourning
on the social media network Twitter, focusing on how users connect over a seven-day period
in the wake of the announcement of the death of a musician. Three musicians who passed
away between 2021 and 2022 were chosen, representing different scenes and eras of modern
music (techno, modern classical, funk). Data was taken from Twitter and formatted using
Python and Table 2 Net to create citation networks of users and mentions that could be
analysed using Gephi to try and ascertain what properties the networks displayed as well as
how users interacted.

This repository contains the source and processed data as well as Gephi and Python files used for the study.
